# SafeArrays - Matrix Multiplication

Using the SafeArray class we are implementating Matrix Multiplication. The program has the necessary bound checks in order for Matrix Multiplication to be successful.

Asides inner functionalities, the program prompts users to first, enter the dimensions of the two matrices they'd like to multiply, and secondly, the values in these matrices. 
Afterwards, the program displays both of the matrices the user has defined, and then the product of them.
